# Object-Oriented-Assignment-5
Java Program using multi-threading and MVC

Because the original ReadMe wasn't very helpful. This program was build up on multiple assignments to what it is now. The idea is that the program reads some input file containing information for bank accounts. From the main window you can open windows for depositing and withdrawing from each account. You can perform these actiosn in multiple currencies: dollar, euro, and chinese yuan.

Now for the final addition for this part of the assignment. Two new windows were added. These windows will run agents that despoit and withdraw automatically. Multiple windows for each account can be open at the same and both deposit and withdraw windows can be running at once. This is done with multithreading so that negative amounts of money are not withdraw and that the agents don't interfere with each other.

The final addition is unit testing. This is minor, but is there.
